# Downloads and Building

You can download the stable version from the website linked above, or from the *Releases* button

Or, you can compile the launcher to get the latest experimental version (with potentially broken and untested features).
To compile the launcher:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Mrmayman/quantumlauncher.git
cd quantum-launcher
cargo run --release
```

You can omit the `--release` flag for faster compile times, but *slightly* worse performance and MUCH larger build file
size.

# Why QuantumLauncher?

- QuantumLauncher provides a feature rich, flexible, simple
  and lightweight experience with plenty of modding features.

What about the others? Well...

- The official Minecraft launcher is slow, unstable, buggy and frustrating to use,
  with barely any modding features.
- Prism Launcher is a great launcher overall, but it does not support
  offline accounts. Same for MultiMC.
- Legacy Launcher isn't as feature rich as this
- TLauncher is *suspected* to be malware

# File Locations

- On *Windows*, the launcher files are at `C:/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/AppData/Roaming/QuantumLauncher/`.
- You probably won't see the `AppData` folder. Press Windows + R and paste this path, and hit enter.
- On *Linux*, the launcher files are at `~/.local/share/QuantumLauncher/`. (`~` refers to your home directory).
- Instances located at `QuantumLauncher/instances/YOUR_INSTANCE/`
- `.minecraft` located at `YOUR_INSTANCE/.minecraft/`.
- Launcher logs are located at `QuantumLauncher/logs/`.

If you play the game in offline mode, it's at your own risk. I am not responsible for any issues caused.
I recommend that you buy the game, but if you don't have the means, feel free to use this launcher as a last resort.
